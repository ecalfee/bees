# Step (0) Gather QTL positions. Make bed files of positions on scaffolds.
# Step (1) Make bed files.
# Step (2) Identify any direct overlap of QTLs and top hits. Any candidate genes?
# Step (2) Assess average ancestry in QTLs vs. not. Use permutations to test significance.
# Step (3) Test for enrichment of top hits in vs. out of QTLs.

# Step (0) Gather QTL positions and make bed files for positions on scaffolds.
# Traits:
# Varroa resistance includes multiple behaviors. I need to verify which are associated with African ancestry specifically:
# - uncapping and removal of freeze-killed brood
	Harpur 2019 GBE Integrative genomics reverals the genetics and evolution of the honey bee's social immune system.
	Artificial selection for two generations on 2 populations (100 colonies each) and compared it to a maintained "baseline" population. Used hapFLK to identify Fst-like haplotype outliers. 
# - Varroa sensitive hygeine
