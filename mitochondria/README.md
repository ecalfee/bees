# Analysis of mtDNA
This attempted analysis was not included in the final paper because I did not get sufficiently high depth of coverage across the mitochondria to make a phylogenetic tree (coverage was very uneven). As an alternative, I analyze allele frequency clines at ancestry informative SNPs in the mitochondria (see clines/)
