NOTE: samtools view -q 1 was added to map_reads.sh partway through this job so that only reads that map at all would be kept in final bam..otherwise files were unnecessarily big..CA0102 had 4051577 reads, CA0914 has 12 million reads that are kept in bam...in contrast, samtools view -q 1 CA0102.sort.dedup.baq.bam | wc -l is only 44k reads, which is ~2.69x (16343bp mtDNA)

# To align mtDNA from the CA Bees from Julie/Ramirez I'll have to get the original fastq files


# (2) Calling SNPs in the mtDNA. Clustering by PCA or a discriminant analysis? Are there diagnostic A C and M mtDNA SNPs?

# (3) What is the distribution of A mtDNA across the hybrid zones? What is the LD between genomewide A ancestry and mtDNA A ancestry?
