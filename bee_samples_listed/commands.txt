# I grouped populations 2014 and 2018 into North America and South America (NA and SA) groupings for FST and pi analysis etc.
# _3 is all included pops in the hybrid zone, and SA has 3 groups: 0, 1, 2 while NA has 2 groups: 1, 2 with ~ 60 bees each:
# Note that Avalon is an outlier excluded from NA_1 and NA_2 but left in the combined group NA_3
