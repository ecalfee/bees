adapted_lite_protocol-2.pdf is from Philipp Brand, passed on from Anne Lorant (JRI lab) and a lab that has developed the method to use diluted Nextera kits for sequencing but not yet published their official method yet.


Nextera prep guidelines (regular protocol form Illumina):
In their protocol you should add 5 uL of tagment DNA enzyme (p.9), so a 24-sample kit should contain at least 120 uL of enzyme.
In the diluted protocol 110 samples use 9 uL of enzyme; so 120 uL (or 1 kit) can cover prep. for 1466 individual samples.
