## Library prep protocol
NexteraLite protocol is published in Rowan et al. 2019 'Nextera Low Input, Transposase Enabled protocol' (https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.119.302406).

Nextera prep guidelines (regular protocol form Illumina):
In their protocol you should add 5 uL of tagment DNA enzyme (p.9), so a 24-sample kit should contain at least 120 uL of enzyme.
In the diluted protocol 110 samples use 9 uL of enzyme; so 120 uL (or 1 kit) can cover prep. for 1466 individual samples.
