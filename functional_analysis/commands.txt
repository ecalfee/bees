# Step (0) Gather QTL and gene positions. Make bed files of positions on scaffolds.
# Step (1) Make bed files.
# Step (2) Identify any direct overlap of QTLs and top hits. Any candidate genes?
# Step (2) Assess average ancestry in QTLs vs. not. Use permutations to test significance.
# Step (3) Test for enrichment of top hits in vs. out of QTLs.

# Step (0) Gather QTL positions and make bed files for positions on scaffolds.
# Traits:
# Varroa resistance includes multiple behaviors. I need to verify which are associated with African ancestry specifically:
# - uncapping and removal of freeze-killed brood
	Harpur 2019 GBE Integrative genomics reverals the genetics and evolution of the honey bee's social immune system.
	Artificial selection for two generations on 2 populations (100 colonies each) and compared it to a maintained "baseline" population. Used hapFLK to identify Fst-like haplotype outliers.

# CA - error because no sites have sig. low A ancestry in CA

# next steps: I found no overlap with Harpur 2019 hygeine gene set. But I also got QTL coordinates for previous work from the supplement of this GBE paper. And I have the conversion from scaffolds to chr coordinates used in this study. BUT I need to put them together to see if I have any overlap with previous QTLs for varroa hygeine. I'm still working on this in rank_genes.R

Arechavaleta-Velasco 2012
Found one sig. time to grooming QTL (study in mexico, so not explicitly, but probably Africanized honey bees)
I downloaded from supplementary table S1 the sequences for the markers in the QTL.
I put these 9 short sequences into a fasta file which I aligned to Amel 4.5:
data/honeybee_genome/QTLs/Arechavaleta-Velasco_2012_grooming$ bowtie2 -f --seed 2014 --very-sensitive-local --local -x ../../honeybee_Amel_4.5 -U markers_in_grooming_QTL.fasta --rg-id Arechavaleta-Verlasco_2012 --rg SM:QTL-grooming | samtools view -b - > markers_in_grooming_QTL.bam
All markers had unique mappings towards the beginning of chromosome 5. I made a bed file from the results, extending 5kb on either side, and including sequence to the closest ends of the two scaffolds. The QTL spans parts of Group5.1 and Group5.2, results saved here:

# TO DO: functional analysis of candidate genes
What have other papers done? e.g. "We used DAVID v 6.7 (Huang et al. 2009) to identify if the list of candidate genes associated with hygienic behavior was enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms, focusing specifically on BP_4, MF_4, and CC_4. All tests we performed using Drosophila homologs identified with BlastP match (E-value threshold 1e-10) and because of our small gene list, we accepted any GO term with P < 0.1" - Harpur 2019
