	Harpur 2019 GBE Integrative genomics reverals the genetics and evolution of the honey bee's social immune system.
	Artificial selection for two generations on 2 populations (100 colonies each) and compared it to a maintained "baseline" population. Used hapFLK to identify Fst-like haplotype outliers.

# next steps: I found no overlap with Harpur 2019 hygeine gene set. But I also got QTL coordinates for previous work from the supplement of this GBE paper. And I have the conversion from scaffolds to chr coordinates used in this study. BUT I need to put them together to see if I have any overlap with previous QTLs for varroa hygeine. I'm still working on this in rank_genes.R

Varroa

Arechavaleta-Velasco 2012
Found one sig. time to grooming QTL (study in mexico, so not explicitly, but probably Africanized honey bees)
I downloaded from supplementary table S1 the sequences for the markers in the QTL.
I put these 9 short sequences into a fasta file which I aligned to Amel 4.5:
data/honeybee_genome/QTLs/Arechavaleta-Velasco_2012_grooming$ bowtie2 -f --seed 2014 --very-sensitive-local --local -x ../../honeybee_Amel_4.5 -U markers_in_grooming_QTL.fasta --rg-id Arechavaleta-Verlasco_2012 --rg SM:QTL-grooming | samtools view -b - > markers_in_grooming_QTL.bam
All markers had unique mappings towards the beginning of chromosome 5. I made a bed file from the results, extending 5kb on either side, and including sequence to the closest ends of the two scaffolds. The QTL spans parts of Group5.1 and Group5.2, results saved here:

# TO DO: functional analysis of candidate genes
What have other papers done? e.g. "We used DAVID v 6.7 (Huang et al. 2009) to identify if the list of candidate genes associated with hygienic behavior was enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms, focusing specifically on BP_4, MF_4, and CC_4. All tests we performed using Drosophila homologs identified with BlastP match (E-value threshold 1e-10) and because of our small gene list, we accepted any GO term with P < 0.1" - Harpur 2019

"Defense response [..] has a clear genetic basis and is often cited as an adaptation contributing to the success of their expansion (Fletcher 1978)."
Citations for "all six previously reported defence response QTL regions that had been
reported with microsatellite markers": (Hunt et al. 1998, Hunt et al. 1999, Guzman-Novoa et al. 2002, Lobo et al. 2003, Gibson et al. 2015) "We used the microsatellite sequence and extracted
BLASTN matches against the honey bee genome (E-value< 1e-5). For all analysis involving
QTLs, we added an additional 50Kb to either side of the QTL"
"We performed hypergeometric tests with DAVID 6.8 (Huang et al. 2009) to identify if
our gene set was enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway terms using Apis
mellifera gene calls against a background of all genes in the honeybee genome."
