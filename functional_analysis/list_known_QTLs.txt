groom-1	grooming varroa	5	2Mb-long-?	Arechavaleta-Velasco 2012	NA	??	
Research shows Africanized honey bees have both higher grooming and VSH (Arechavaleta-Velasco 2012)
*Many of these studies use linkage map 1995 Hunt based on RAPD markers (Genetics)

	
Behrens 2011 is probably in the end less useful because it's small effect epistatic and mapping reproduction suppression, which I'm not sure segregates in Africanized honey bees.
