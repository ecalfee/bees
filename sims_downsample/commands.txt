# using called SNPs and genotypes for high-coverage bees:
# ancestry reference pops: Harpur A, C, and M bees
# admixed bees: Riverside_2014 (n=8)
# original data: from Julie, in data/bees_new_positions/ALL.bam ALL.fam ALL.map
# note: the original positions in ALL.map are incorrect because gaps between scaffolds are skipped
# over for physical positions and recombination/genetic distance was calculated
# with a chromosomal mean recombination rate. I will need to recalculate.

# total number of SNPs passing Julie's filtering:
data/bees_new_positions$ wc -l ALL.map

# This leaves about 650k SNPs. I did not filter for differences between ancestries because I didn't want to bias my results for SNPs informative C-M but not, for example A-C which has lower Fst

# Then I filter for SNPs with high LD in the A population using plink and a sliding window of 50 SNPs
# greedily removing SNPs until no pairs in the window have r^2 > .4 , then shifting the window by 10 SNPs
bees_new_positions$ plink --bfile ALL --indep-pairwise 50 10 0.4 --keep-allele-order --extract ACM_common.frq --filter populations.txt A --out lowLDA4

# this leaves 160k SNPs
bees_new_positions$ wc -l lowLDA4.prune.in161036 lowLDA4.prune.in

# now I get allele counts for Harpur A C M for those positions (and I put all the lowLD files in a folder) lowLDA4
for pop in A C M; do plink --bfile ALL --freq counts --keep-allele-order --extract lowLDA4/lowLDA4.prune.in --filter populations.txt $pop --out lowLDA4/$pop; done

# I also try an alternative windowed approach to filter SNPs:
# The idea is that on average LD decays quickly in honeybees and in all major groups A, C, M and O, mean r^2 is below 0.1 at greater than 1.5 kb https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3077/figures/8 .
# Based on this information, I only look for r^2 above 0.2 in the African population in widows length 1.5 kb to avoid chance spurious results at unreasonably great distances
data/bees_new_positions$ plink -bfile ALL --indep-pairwise 1.5 kb 1 0.2 --keep-allele-order --extract ACM_common.frq --filter populations.txt A --out newlowLDA2/snps

# now I get allele counts for each individual in Riverside_2014 for those same alleles.

# now I get the recombination positions based on Wallberg recombination map for each position at 100,000 resolution (could go down to 10,000 or lower, but some smoothing is likely more accurate). Note: As I understand it, this map skips over gaps between scaffolds as if the gaps did not exist and it's contiguous sequence (same with bp position for v4.5 genome). The lower resolution maps do the same, but omit a recombination rate for any window bridging scaffolds as it's not estimated well. [or do they have gaps of 50,000 bp represented in these positions? It seems like if that's the case there would be regions with no 10,000 map.

# now I merge the files to the correct format for ancestry_hmm

# now I run ancestry_hmm, allowing to estimate time since admixture between 2 and 60 generations (1-2 yrs/gen & admixture after 1957 - present/2014 sample)

# I binomially sample 'reads' for coverage and re-run ancestry_hmm
