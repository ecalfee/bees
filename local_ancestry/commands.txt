# (2) run ancestry_hmm with all bees together and a 5% A freq, 85% C and 10% M prior
# (3) run ancestry_hmm for different groups separately, grouping bees into larger 'populations' based on roughly similar global ancestry proportions


# Verify general expected patterns
# look at estimated times since admixture and visualize some block lengths
# what portion of calls are heterozygous for ancestry? what portion are high confidence calls?
# how many of the LD-filtered SNPs, on average, fall within an ancestry block?
# do bees from the same hybrid zone have more similar local ancestry than across CA/Argentina?

# TO DO: I should update the bp positions in the ALL.bed file because some (short?) scaffolds are getting no SNPs, presumably because my LD filter is requiring 1000bp into the scaffold because it doesn't consider gaps between scaffolds. I could also then incorporate cM position into the SNPs file and extract genetic distances between SNPs, and recombination rates at each SNP, from plink
# TO DO: maybe I should be removing sites with > 2.5x mean ind. depth in R too, or likely triallelic sites where maj/min allele are very uncommon <.1 reads for a bee (plot and see if there's a peak)
