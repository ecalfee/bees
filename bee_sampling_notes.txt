# Sequencing estimates of coverage and cost:

$2450 per HiSeq4000 at UC Berkeley. Unknown library prep costs.
I can sequence 96 bees at 4x coverage (with 2% duplicate reads) on one lane
http://qb3.berkeley.edu/gsl/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Rates-2017_2018-170901_SM.pdf

With two lanes, I could sequence 192 bees at 4x coverage, or 19 populations of 10 bees each

Placerita to Tulare is one option for CA (245km):

Another option would be to go up Inyo county (possibly less affected by commercial beekeeping?)

I've emailed Eric Mussen at UCD based on this random interview http://entomology.ucdavis.edu/News/Africanized_Honey_Bees_in_Modesto_Isolated_Case_in_the_Northern_San_Joaquin_Valley/

A big open question is how much $ I am going to need for sample preparation .. I'm really not sure about different kits.
