# global ancestry assessed by
# (1) PCA
# (2) NGSAdmix
# All implemented in ANGSD based off of genotype likelihoods at SNPs in low LD

# SNPs need to be in low LD for this analysis.
# for input files in results/input/, I concatenate the GL for every 1000th SNP for ordered scaffolds:
# first make a list of gl files in order (different order will give different SNPs):
bees/global_ancestry$
# then thin to every 1000th SNP:
bees/global_ancestry$
