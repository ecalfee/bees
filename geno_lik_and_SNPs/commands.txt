# Analysis of genotype likelihoods (in ANGSD)
# 2 main SNP sets:
# (1) variant sites called from genotype likelihood analysis in ANGSD and
# (2) variant sites pre-identified from reference populations (SNP set from Julie)

# make list of included bees and corresponding bams for pass1 analysis, including referenced A, M, and C bees, plus any CA bees collected
# after the Africanized honey bee invasion reached CA in 1994, and the first set of sequenced new CA/AR bees:
bees/bee_samples_listed$ cat post_1994.list > pass1.list; cat ../data/novo_seq/C202SC18101772/samples.list >> pass1.list
bees/bee_samples_listed$ for i in $(cat pass1.list); do echo ../filtered_bams/results/$i.sort.dedup.baq.bam; done > pass1.bams

# For calling variant sites in ANGSD, we divide the genome into regions
# and use reference and CA_Bees in addition to first lane of newly sequenced bees, all listed in pass1.list
# We use a non-HW dependent SNP calling algorithm based on counts of reads in ANGSD
# and filter out sites with unusually high or low coverage (> 2x or < .5x mean coverage)
# then the samtools GL function to get genotype likelihoods for each individual,
# all filtering out low quality reads and bases
# for now I just use minimum total depth, not a minimum # individuals cutoff

# turns out I had a duplicated record in pass1.list (ap50). Moved old bam lists to bee_samples_listed/with_duplicated_ap50
# and created new nonduplicated lists for all.meta post_1994.meta post_1994.list and pass1.list, e.g.:
bee_samples_listed$ uniq with_duplicated_ap50/pass1.list > pass1.list

# then added Kohn bees to make new GL and SNP files including these bees:
# note: I did not re-calculate coverage, so these are just estimates for about .5x and 2x cutoffs based on adding 2 bees of ~20x coverage (and ~15x for Mex bee)

# TO DO:
# Add in Wallberg 2014 reference bees too, filtering for SOLiD/SHRiMP normodds mapping quality score.
# Re-calculate cutoffs for coverage to exclude SNPs with low coverage and likely mapping errors
