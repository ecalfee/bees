# Analysis of genotype likelihoods (in ANGSD)
# 2 main SNP sets:
# (1) variant sites called from genotype likelihood analysis in ANGSD and
# (2) variant sites pre-identified from reference populations (SNP set from Julie)

# For calling variant sites in ANGSD, we divide the genome into regions
# and use reference and CA_Bees in addition to first lane of newly sequenced bees, all listed in pass1.list
# We use a non-HW dependent SNP calling algorithm based on counts of reads in ANGSD
# and filter out sites with unusually high or low coverage (> 2x or < .5x mean coverage)
# and where fewer than half the sample has data,
# then the samtools GL function to get genotype likelihoods for each individual,
# all filtering out low quality reads and bases

# TO DO:
# Divide honeybee genome into shorter genomic regions to run analysis
# make list of included bees for pass1.list, using IDs matching filtered_bams/results/ID.sort.dedup.baq.bam:
bees/bee_samples_listed$ cat post_1994.list > pass1.list; cat ../data/novo_seq/C202SC18101772/samples.list >> pass1.list
