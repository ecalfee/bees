https://www.jstor.org/stable/24040316?seq=12#metadata_info_tab_contents is a good general resource for historical record & spread
47 initial imported African queeens survived, 26 escaped swarms from the central part of Sao Paulo state in brazil in 1957
~320km/year diffusion rate. But note that 1957-61 is a lot shorter diffusion radius than 1962-66 (at which point it's likely N-S split had effectively already occurred.
Taylor & Spivak 1984 p. 39: climate limits of hte hybrid are determined by mean temp maximum for the coldest month (July in S. America).
Temperate honey bees use behavioral clustering inside the hive and honey bee stores to maintain warm in extended cold periods

plot_clines.R:
# For climate variables, I download spatial data from worldclim.org
using the Raster package in R, which retrieves bioclim1.4 
with climatic variable averages 1960-1990 for 19 bioclim variables

I also downloaded 1961-1990 (by decade) from another databease CRU TS 4.03 to get model-estimated days of frost, based on monthly mean temps and diurnal range.
https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/cru_ts_4.03/cruts.1905011326.v4.03/frs/
frosty <- read.table("~/Downloads/cru_ts4.03.1961.1970.frs.dat.gz")
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE UNITS HERE!


So I also downloaded 10minute resolution for an average 1961-1990 frost
https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/tmc/
~/Downloads/grid_10min_frs.dat.gz
BUT this isn't in an easy-to-use format, so I'll leave it for now.

Descriptions of the 19 pre-computed bioclim variables can be found here:
http://worldclim.org/bioclim
I could alternatively compute these myself from monthly data using the R package dismo

I could likewise compute the per-month frost estimate using the approximations from CRU, but they have an unlabelled variable x.
Alternatively, I could use this 0.5min spatial resolution of global frost days, with caveats that it's 
most accurate in the arctic and uses different temporal range 1920-1980

TO DO: ignoring frost, just using 0.5 resolution bioclim variables, first do a pca and use the first 5 PCs as covariates in a linear model of ancestry. Then re-run all the models with individual variables and print a table for the manuscript supplement. Decide what you want your final plot to be for the paper and update that section of the manuscript results.
