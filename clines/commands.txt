47 initial imported African queeens survived, 26 escaped swarms from the central part of Sao Paulo state in brazil in 1957
~320km/year diffusion rate. But note that 1957-61 is a lot shorter diffusion radius than 1962-66 (at which point it's likely N-S split had effectively already occurred.
Taylor & Spivak 1984 p. 39: climate limits of hte hybrid are determined by mean temp maximum for the coldest month (July in S. America).
Temperate honey bees use behavioral clustering inside the hive and honey bee stores to maintain warm in extended cold periods

# Mean ancestry clines (using global ancestry for each individual):
plot_clines.R:
# For climate variables, I download spatial data from worldclim.org
using the Raster package in R, which retrieves bioclim1.4
with climatic variable averages 1960-1990 for 19 bioclim variables

I also downloaded 1961-1990 (by decade) from another databease CRU TS 4.03 to get model-estimated days of frost, based on monthly mean temps and diurnal range.
https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/cru_ts_4.03/cruts.1905011326.v4.03/frs/
frosty <- read.table("~/Downloads/cru_ts4.03.1961.1970.frs.dat.gz")
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE UNITS HERE!

So I also downloaded 10minute resolution for an average 1961-1990 frost
https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/tmc/
~/Downloads/grid_10min_frs.dat.gz
BUT this isn't in an easy-to-use format, so I'll leave it for now.

Descriptions of the 19 pre-computed bioclim variables can be found here:
http://worldclim.org/bioclim
I could alternatively compute these myself from monthly data using the R package dismo

I could likewise compute the per-month frost estimate using the approximations from CRU, but they have an unlabelled variable x.
Alternatively, I could use this 0.5min spatial resolution of global frost days, with caveats that it's
most accurate in the arctic and uses different temporal range 1920-1980

# Individual loci clines (using mean local ancestry for each population):
# NOTE: I could use individual ancestry, not population mean, but I don't think it's worth the computatational intensity as Argentinian populations are sampled fairly evenly. I don't try to fit clines to just CA for now because I only sampled half the zone. Also, I use ML not map because it's very similar and faster.
# betareg_clines_ind_loci.R has code to fit a ML beta regression to each snp with an ancestry cline # cite betareg paper. I use this to run fits in parallel.

# note: the simulations run all snps at once but I broke up the A ancestry observations into 5 sets

Silu Wang 2019 Evolutionary Biology. Has a b = 4/w in her cline parameterization
"To examine the location and width of the geographical clines, we used the nls function in R to fit an equilibrium sigmoidal cline model (Gay et al., 2008; Szymura & Barton, 1986) to the relationship between site location (x) and site mean HI (y). The fit of this model was used to estimate cline centre (c) and width (w). This was done for each sampling period. The confidence intervals of c and w were acquired by assuming asymptotic normality, using the confint function in R."
"We therefore used AIC (Akaike, 1973) to compare cline models of 2015–16 to the ‘fixed‐centre cline model’ that has cline centres fixed to the estimates of cline centres in 1987–94, c1987‐94 (widths were allowed to differ). "
Used multiple time points to estimate if neutral diffusion is at play:
"We tested the change of cline width against the neutral diffusion model (Barton & Hewitt, 1985),
where w is the cline width, MATH is the standard deviation of parental‐offspring distance and t is the number of generations since the formation of hybrid zone."
# I may be better off trying to estimate deviation from neutrality Using
# the center vs. edges of the hybrid zone contrast..in one of the classic Barton & Szymura papers

TO DO: ignoring frost, just using 0.5 resolution bioclim variables, first do a pca and use the first 5 PCs as covariates in a linear model of ancestry. Then re-run all the models with individual variables and print a table for the manuscript supplement. Decide what you want your final plot to be for the paper and update that section of the manuscript results.
